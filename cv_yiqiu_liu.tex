\subsection*{Equally Married, Equally Benefited: Same-sex Marriage, Health Insurance, Labor Market, and Social Security} 
\\ 

Abstract: This study examines the impacts of two landmark Supreme Court rulings related to same-sex marriage in the United States – United States v. Windsor in 2013 and Obergefell v. Hodges in 2015 – on various outcomes for same-sex couples with American Community Survey micro-data. Utilizing a difference-in-differences approach that leverages the differential timing of legalization across states, the analysis isolates the effects of federal recognition of existing same-sex marriages and nationwide marriage equality. The findings demonstrate how policy interventions can mitigate disparities and promote equity for marginalized groups by reshaping economic incentives associated with marriage.

\subsection*{Mental Health Effect of the COVID Citywide Lockdown: A Double ML Estimation} \\ 

Abstract: This paper contributes to the growing literatures studying the mental health outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic, and offers further empirical evidence of the negative mental health impact of citywide lockdowns by studying the lockdown happened in Shanghai, People’s Republic of China during April, and May 2022. Both my baseline OLS and Double Machine Learning (DML) estimation shows that Baidu searches among locked down Shanghai residents of keywords including “depression” and “anxiety” statistically significantly increased during the citywide lockdown. Baidu searches on “suicide” shows mixed results, indicating potential heterogeneity among residents. \\

\subsection*{The Impact of Medicaid Expansion on Health Insurance Coverage and Health Outcome}
Abstract: The Affordable Care Act (ACA) of 2010 expanded the eligibility of the Medicaid, which proves to significantly promote the insurance coverage of all Americans. This paper focuses on the dynamic effect of the change in policy using a staggered Differences-in-differences method, as well as the heterogeneous responses from groups that implemented the expansion later in time. I documented additional evidence that the ACA expansion on Medicaid eligibility improved the health insurance take-up rate by at least 6.7\%, and the effects are persistent over a longer period. At the same time, later expansion states exhibited smaller improvements.
